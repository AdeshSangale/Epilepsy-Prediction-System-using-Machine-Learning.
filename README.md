This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution for predicting epileptic seizures using EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, and early detection of seizures can significantly improve patient safety and quality of life.

ðŸ”¹ Features

EEG data preprocessing and noise removal

Feature extraction using statistical & frequency methods

Machine Learning & Deep Learning models (SVM, Random Forest, CNN, LSTM)

Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Real-time seizure prediction capability

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset: Publicly available EEG datasets (e.g., CHB-MIT Scalp EEG)

ðŸ”¹ Goal

To build an intelligent system that helps doctors, caregivers, and patients by providing early warnings of epileptic seizures, enabling timely intervention and better healthcare outcomes.
